// RELEASE NOTES (Version 3.3)
//
// All emulator preferences have been merged into a unified preferences pane.
// New options in the emulator settings allow the user to customize the actions that are taken when opening a media file.
// The input device selection is now retained in the user default storage.
// The user can now choose whether to save the emulator texture or the upscaled texture as a screenshot image.
// If menu item "Save Snapshot..." is selected, emulation is paused until the screenshot has been saved.
// Dot mask emulation has been modified to not darken the screen any more.
// The bloom radius can be set individually for each color channels now. 
// Cathode rays can be shifted relative to each other.
// Added support for the Expert cartridge.
// Cardridge buttons are now displayed in the bottom bar as small (clickable) icons.
// Upgraded ReSID to the version used in VICE V3.3.
// Added code to dynamically adjust the sampling rate to reduce buffer underflows and overflows.
// Fixed a bug that made FastSID unusable on audio hardware with a sample rate other than 44.1khz.
// The assignment of keystrokes to joystick events has been improved when multiple keys are pressed at the same time.

// Update IEC bus inside CIA and VIA. Use delay flags if neccessary
// Use a simpler implementation for the raster irq trigger. Edge sensitive matching value
// Call CA1 action in VIA class only if the pin value really has changed.
//
