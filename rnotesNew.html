				<p>It has been a while since the last version of VirtualC64 was released and there have been no
					updates since then. One reason for this is that I have been working intensively on vAmiga during the
					last months. Another reason is that I have included many more new features in the new version than
					originally planned. This took some time. But as of today VirtualC64 4.0 is finally ready to go.</p>
				<p>
					Version 4.0 is a major update that brings many GUI features to VirtualC64 that were originally
					implemented for vAmiga. Now both emulators have a consistent look and feel as well as a very  
					similar feature list.</p>
				<p><b>
					Please note: Version 4.0 contains many more internal code changes than any other delta release in
					the past. Although most of these changes do not directly affect the user, some of them do. For
					example, all user defaults keys have been renamed, which means that your personal settings will be
					lost after an update. Please keep this in mind if you choose to upgrade to the new version.</b>
