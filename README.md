### About

VirtualC64 emulates a Commodore 64 on your Apple Macintosh. The project attempts to create an emulator that combines three key objectives: A high emulation accuracy, an easy-to-use interface, and a well-documented and easy-to-understand code base. VirtualC64 has a long development history under its belt. Originally, the emulator was intended as a demonstrator of a virtual CPU environment that can be used in a one-year or two-year course on computer engineering. Over the years, VirtualC64 has become more and more accurate and evolved into a full-blown emulator.

### ROMs

When the emulator launches for the first time, you will be prompted to add four Rom images per drag-and-drop. Due to their unclear copyright status, the Rom images are not pre-installed. As a side note, however, it should be mentioned that VirtualC64 has been designed to be compatible with the Rom images included with other C64 emulators such as VICE.

### Features

With VirtualC64 I tried to create a virtual computer that is as transparent as possible. For this purpose the emulator offers numerous panels that allow to inspect and monitor the individual components of the C64. In addition, it is possible to stop the computer any time and single-step through the currently executed program.

### Third-party gamepad support

At present, the emulator supports only a limited number of third-party game controllers. However, I am trying to expand the list of supported devices constantly. Since I can only make the necessary code changes for devices in my possession, I have created an [Amazon wish list](https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/35K6X4B0FIEOF?ref_=wl_share) containing a number of yet incompatible devices. If you want to have another controller supported, please let me know the exact model name. I will then add it to the wishlist, and with a bit of luck, a noble donor will be found who will order the device.
