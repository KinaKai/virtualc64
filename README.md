## About

VirtualC64 emulates a Commodore 64 on the Mac. Originally, the emulator was intended as a demonstration of a virtual CPU environment that can be used in a one-year or two-year course on computer technology. Over the years, the emulator has grown and its emulation accuracy has increased continuously. Although the emulator has not yet reached the impressive compatibility of VICE or Hoxs64, VirtualC64 has evolved into a full-blown C64 emulator over the years.  
 
VirtualC64 has three goals. In addition to achieving a high level of compatibility, I want to create a user interface that is as easy to use as possible. Thirdly, I am trying to create a well-documented and understandable code base. If you can identify with these goals, I would be happy to actively participate in this project. Please note that I don't want to port the emulator to another operating system at the moment. 

VirtualC64 is open source and released under the GNU General Public License.

## Third-party gamepad support

At present, the emulator supports only a limited number of third-party game controllers. However, I am trying to expand the list of supported devices constantly. Since I can only make the necessary code changes for devices in my possession, I have created an [Amazon wish list](https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/35K6X4B0FIEOF?ref_=wl_share) containing a number of yet incompatible devices. If you want to have another controller supported, please let me know the exact model name. I will then add it to the wishlist, and with a bit of luck, a noble donor will be found who will order the device.
